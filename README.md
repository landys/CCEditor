# CCEditor

It's a text editor win application similar as NotePad in VB. It's a friend's course project written in my second year undergraduate in Jul 2005.

You can directly run the app by clicking "bin/CCEditor.exe". If you met errors related with "RichTx32.ocx" in Windows 7 64bit, you need to register it as follows. "RichTx32.ocx" is actually used in old VB applications.

1. Download and copy RichTx32.ocx to the following directory: C:\Windows\SysWoW64
2. Run "cmd" with "Run as Administrator"
3. Run the command "%systemroot%\SysWoW64\regsvr32.exe RichTx32.ocx", and the OCX should be registered successfully.
